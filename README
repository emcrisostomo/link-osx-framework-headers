This is link-osx-framework-headers.zsh, a ZSH shell script that scans the
framework directories of OS X and:

  * Creates a symbolic link to a framework headers' directory.
  * Creates a symbolic link to the headers' directory of every sub-framework
    of a framework.

  All the symbolic links are created in the script working directory (usually
the directory from which the script is invoked).  "Flattening" the framework
hierarchy is required so that C/C++ IDEs that do not understand (yet) the
layout of Apple frameworks are able to scan the framework hedear files
correctly.  Current versions of NetBeans C++ and Eclipse CDT are affected
by this problem.

  Further information about this problem, how this script can help you solve it
and how to properly configure such an IDE can be found in this blog post:

http://thegreyblog.blogspot.com/2014/02/how-to-include-apple-frameworks-headers.html

  This script is a ZSH shell script which should work out of the box on any
recent OS X release.

Installation
============

The quickest way to install this package is:

  * Configuration and build:

    $ ./configure && make

  * Installation:

    $ sudo make install

    or

    # make install

    if you have sufficient privileges to write into the directory tree rooted
in /usr/local.

  See the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure and install
fsw.

Dependencies
============

link-osx-framework-headers.zsh is a Z shell script and ZSH is required to
execute it.  The configure script checks for ZSH and fails if absent.  Since
the Z Shell is shipped with every recent OS X release, this bundle shuold be
self-contained.

  No other software packages or dependencies are required to configure and
install fsw.

Usage
=====

link-osx-framework-headers.zsh accepts a list of framework names.  A framework
name does not contain the ".framework" suffix.  That is:

  * CoreServices is a valid framework name.
  * CoreServices.framework is not a valid framework name.

  The basic syntax is:

  $ link-osx-framework-headers.zsh framework-0 ... framework-n

The script will loop on the specified framework names and will process them one
by one.  The script will scan the OS X framework base directories (in this
order), which currently are:

  * /System/Library/Frameworks
  * /Library/Frameworks

looking for a framework directory (named "framework-name.framework").  If such
a directory is found, the script will:

  * Check whether a Headers directory exists and if it does, create a symbolic
    link in the current directory named after the framework (without the
    .framework suffix).
  * Check whether sub-framework exists.  A sub-framework is a directory whose
    name ends with ".framework".  For each such directory, repeat the process.

  If a corresponding framework directory is not found, a warning is issued to
the standard error and the script will continue with the next framework name.

  If the script is invoked with no arguments, it will dump the paths of the
frameworks founds on the configured framework root directories.
